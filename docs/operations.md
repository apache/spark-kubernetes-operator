### Compatibility

- Java 17 and 21
- Kubernetes version compatibility:
    + k8s version >= 1.28 is recommended. Operator attempts to be API compatible as possible, but 
      patch support will not be performed on k8s versions that reached EOL.
- Spark versions 3.5 or above.

### Spark Application Namespaces

By default, Spark applications are created in the same namespace as the operator deployment.
You many also configure the chart deployment to add necessary RBAC resources for
applications to enable them running in additional namespaces.

## Overriding configuration parameters during Helm install

Helm provides different ways to override the default installation parameters (contained
in `values.yaml`) for the Helm chart.

To override single parameters you can use `--set`, for example:

```
helm install --set image.repository=<my_registory>/spark-kubernetes-operator \
   -f build-tools/helm/spark-kubernetes-operator/values.yaml \
  build-tools/helm/spark-kubernetes-operator/
```

You can also provide multiple custom values file by using the `-f` flag, the latest takes
higher precedence:

```
helm install spark-kubernetes-operator \
   -f build-tools/helm/spark-kubernetes-operator/values.yaml \
   -f my_values.yaml \
   build-tools/helm/spark-kubernetes-operator/
```

The configurable parameters of the Helm chart and which default values as detailed in the
following table:

__Notice__: The pod resources should be set as your workload in different environments to
archive a matched K8s pod QoS. See

## Operator Health(Liveness) Probe with Sentinel Resource

Learning
from [Apache Flink Operator](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-main/docs/operations/health/#canary-resources),
a dummy spark application resource in any watched namespace can help Spark operator health
probe monitor.

Here is a Spark Sentinel resource example with the label `"spark.operator/sentinel": "true"`
and it will not result in creation of any other kubernetes resources. Controlled by
property `health.sentinel.resource.reconciliation.delay.seconds`, by default, the timeout to
reconcile the sentinel resources is 60 seconds. If the operator cannot reconcile these
resources within limited time, the operator health probe will return HTTP code 500 when kubelet
send the HTTP Get to the liveness endpoint, and the
kubelet will then kill the spark operator container and restart it.

```yaml
apiVersion: org.apache.spark/v1alpha1
kind: SparkApplication
metadata:
  name: spark-sentinel-resources
  labels:
    "spark.operator/sentinel": "true"
```
